# Roadmap: Discord AI Keeper

## Overview

Milestone `v1.0` established the Discord-first local-DM runtime with deterministic rules, persistence, diagnostics, and a starter packaged adventure. Milestone `v1.1` introduced a formal module runtime and shipped `疯狂之馆` as the first structured full-length module. Milestone `v1.2` added ready-gated startup, mature dice integration, and true Discord streaming. Milestone `v1.3` polished live-play feel through structured judgement, bounded guidance, and keeper-style scene framing. Milestone `v1.4` introduced room graphs, AI-first extraction drafts, and location-driven play. Milestone `v1.5` completed the missing execution layer with a reusable trigger tree and consequence engine. Milestone `v1.6` pivots that foundation into a COC/Keeper-first runtime using local rulebooks, investigator assets, and COC module semantics. Milestone `v1.7` extends that base with persistent investigator panels, private knowledge flow, mixed room/scene/event graphs, and the first `覆辙`-class complex module sample.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 13: Structured Judgement And Roll Prompting** - Add keeper-style action judgement and explicit roll prompting.
- [x] **Phase 14: Hint Timing, Clue Flow, And Stall Recovery** - Add bounded guidance tiers and stall recovery.
- [x] **Phase 15: Keeper-Style Scene Framing And Consequence Presentation** - Strengthen room introductions, pressure, and return-to-choice rhythm.
- [x] **Phase 16: Room Graph Runtime Foundations** - Introduce location graphs, adjacency, and location-aware runtime state.
- [x] **Phase 17: AI Extraction For Room Graphs And Trigger Trees** - Add AI-first, reviewable extraction drafts for room graphs and trigger trees.
- [x] **Phase 18: 疯狂之馆 Room-Graph Migration** - Migrate `疯狂之馆` into room-graph-driven play behavior.
- [x] **Phase 19: Generic Trigger And Consequence Schema** - Introduce a reusable trigger tree schema with declarative conditions, effects, and hook boundaries.
- [x] **Phase 20: Runtime Trigger Engine** - Execute trigger trees into persisted consequence chains and event logs.
- [x] **Phase 21: 疯狂之馆 Trigger Migration** - Migrate key `疯狂之馆` beats onto the generic trigger engine.
- [x] **Phase 22: COC Runtime Foundations** - Add COC 7th keeper-facing checks, SAN-aware resolution, and non-D&D runtime semantics on top of the existing engine.
- [x] **Phase 23: COC Asset And Character Intake** - Build reviewable knowledge and investigator intake paths from local rulebooks, pregens, templates, and curated COC references.
- [x] **Phase 24: COC Module And Keeper Experience Migration** - Reframe prompts, diagnostics, and module extraction around COC investigation flow and reusable keeper-style play.
- [x] **Phase 25: Investigator Panel Runtime** - Add persistent per-player investigator panels and panel-linked scenario state grounded in COC rules and explicit module metadata.
- [x] **Phase 26: Private Knowledge And Complex Module Graphs** - Extend runtime structure to support mixed room/scene/event graphs plus player- or group-scoped truths for complex investigations.
- [x] **Phase 27: 覆辙 Complex Module Migration** - Migrate `覆辙` as the first complex COC module sample and fold any needed primitives back into reusable runtime abstractions.

## Milestone v1.7 Delivery Plan

### Phase 25: Investigator Panel Runtime
**Delivered**:
- Add persistent per-player panels inspired by mature COC character generators, but backed by the project's own structured runtime and local rules.
- Support multiple investigator templates and mutable scenario-linked state such as SAN, HP, MP, Luck, injuries, and explicit module effects.
- Ensure panel fields remain grounded in local COC rulebooks or reviewable module metadata.

### Phase 26: Private Knowledge And Complex Module Graphs
**Delivered**:
- Support mixed room/scene/event graphs so complex modules do not collapse into room-only navigation.
- Add player-private and group-scoped clues, truths, and prompts for asymmetrical investigations.
- Distinguish canonical COC rules from explicit module-specific rules in diagnostics and runtime handling.

### Phase 27: 覆辙 Complex Module Migration
**Delivered**:
- Migrate `覆辙` as the first complex-module sample with dual entry tracks, asymmetrical truths, module-specific consequences, and longer-form state.
- Use the migration to expose which new primitives are genuinely reusable and which must remain explicit scenario rules.
- Keep all added mechanics constrained either to local COC rules or reviewable module rules, never to hidden prompt invention.
