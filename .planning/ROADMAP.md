# Roadmap: Discord AI Keeper

## Overview

This roadmap is now organized by persistent product tracks, not only by historical phase order. GSD agents should first choose the relevant track, then choose the next milestone inside that track.

Historical phase execution still matters and remains recorded in `MILESTONES.md`, but future planning should use the track structure below.

## Track A Roadmap: 模组与规则运行层

- `v1.4` room-graph runtime and AI-first extraction draft
- `v1.5` trigger tree and consequence engine
- `v1.6` COC/Keeper-first runtime pivot
- `v1.7` mixed room/scene/event graph and `覆辙` complex-module baseline

### Completed Phases

- admin detail views
- force-activate/archive/delete flows
- clearer player/admin separation

#### `B3` Character Finishing And COC-Bounded Projection
Goal:
- Let interviews shape legal finishing choices and campaign projections without inventing house rules.

Includes:
- bounded finishing recommendations
- transparent projection logic

#### `B4` Advanced Character Assets
Goal:
- Support richer long-term identity surfaces and future non-bot UI.

Includes:
- panel-ready data groupings
- richer role overlays for complex modules

## Track C Roadmap: Discord 交互层

## Governance Milestone

### `v2.2` GSD Track Governance Restructure

Primary purpose:
- make the repository legible to any GSD-driven AI or collaborator by formalizing tracks and global rules

Planned phases:
- Phase 40: Track Model And Global Rules
- Phase 41: Planning Document Restructure
- Phase 42: Collaboration And README Alignment

## Current Recommendation

If a new collaborator needs to choose what to work on next:

1. Pick a track.
2. Confirm the track choice against `PROJECT.md`.
3. Use this roadmap to choose the next milestone in that track.
4. Check `STATE.md` to avoid conflicting with the currently active milestone.
