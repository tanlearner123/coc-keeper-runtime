# Discord AI DM

## What This Is

This project is a Discord-native Dungeons & Dragons DM system powered by local models. Multiple real players can participate in the same session, the bot acts as the DM, and the system can switch between normal DM-led play and multi-character performance scenes where the bot speaks as several NPCs or enemies.

The target is not a lightweight chat toy. It should be reliable enough to run short-to-medium campaigns with strong rules support, persistent state, and external character data connected through the simplest viable integration path.

## Core Value

Run a real multiplayer D&D session in Discord where a local AI DM can narrate, roleplay multiple characters, and enforce heavy rules flow without constant manual bookkeeping.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Multiplayer Discord sessions support multiple human players in the same campaign channel or thread.
- [ ] The DM flow supports two modes: normal DM-led narration and scene-based multi-character performance.
- [ ] The system can play multiple NPCs, enemies, or companions as distinct speaking roles in the same session.
- [ ] The rules layer supports heavy D&D flow including combat, initiative, HP, conditions, spell/rule lookup, and resource tracking.
- [ ] Character data comes from an external or importable source using the simplest viable mature integration path rather than a large custom character platform.
- [ ] The first usable release can reliably run a one-shot or short campaign with persistent game state and recoverable session context.

### Out of Scope

- Building every D&D subsystem from scratch when stable mature projects or datasets already exist — this is explicitly excluded to reduce debugging cost and delivery time.
- Telegram support in v1 — Discord is the chosen primary runtime environment.
- Full product-grade parity with mature ecosystem bots on day one — v1 should be campaign-usable, not feature-complete against every existing tool.

## Context

The system will run on Discord and use a dual-model architecture on local inference. `L3-8B-Stheno-v3.2` is intended to handle narration, DM voice, and multi-character roleplay. A smaller fast model will handle routing and structured control decisions.

The project should preferentially reuse mature external components instead of inventing custom equivalents. Current candidate references include `DND5E-MCP` as an AI-facing rules/lookup skill, `5e-srd-api` as a stable SRD-backed rules data source, and `Avrae` as a reference implementation for interaction patterns and D&D automation design rather than as the core embedded runtime.

The first release should prioritize running the full Discord gameplay loop end-to-end: player input, orchestration, rule/tool invocation, state updates, and narrated DM output. External character integration should be chosen based on the lowest-friction mature option, not on brand preference.

## Constraints

- **Platform**: Discord-first — the system must work naturally in Discord channels or threads because that is the chosen runtime surface.
- **Inference**: Local models — narration and control should run through local model infrastructure rather than a hosted LLM dependency.
- **Architecture**: Reuse mature projects first — stable existing tools, APIs, and datasets should be integrated before writing custom subsystems.
- **Rules Scope**: Heavy rules support in v1 — combat, initiative, HP, conditions, spells, and resource tracking are not optional side features.
- **Delivery**: First release should optimize for campaign-usable reliability over maximal scope — reducing integration and debugging cost is a priority.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Discord is the primary platform | It supports the desired multiplayer session format better than Telegram for this project | — Pending |
| The gameplay style is hybrid DM + multi-character performance | The desired experience is DM-led play with scene-based switching into NPC ensemble dialogue | — Pending |
| Multiple real players and bot-played roles are both required | The system must support real group play while also animating the world through NPCs and enemies | — Pending |
| Rules support should be heavy rather than lightweight | The goal is to reduce manual bookkeeping and allow campaign-grade play | — Pending |
| v1 should prioritize end-to-end gameplay over perfect character integration | A playable Discord session loop matters more than building an elaborate character platform first | — Pending |
| Mature external projects should be reused wherever practical | This reduces implementation risk and debugging cost | — Pending |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `$gsd-transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `$gsd-complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
