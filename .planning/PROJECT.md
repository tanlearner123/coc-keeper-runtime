# Discord AI DM

## What This Is

This project is a Discord-native Dungeons & Dragons DM system powered by local models. Multiple real players can participate in the same session, the bot acts as the DM, and the system can switch between normal DM-led play and multi-character performance scenes where the bot speaks as several NPCs or enemies.

The target is not a lightweight chat toy. It should be reliable enough to run short-to-medium campaigns with strong rules support, persistent state, and external character data connected through the simplest viable integration path.

## Core Value

Run a real multiplayer D&D session in Discord where a local AI DM can narrate, roleplay multiple characters, and enforce heavy rules flow without constant manual bookkeeping.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Discord bot can run a bound multiplayer campaign in one channel with slash-command setup and local-model orchestration — v1.0 Phases 1-5
- ✓ Router and narrator are separated so structured decisions and final prose do not share authority — v1.0 Phase 1
- ✓ Deterministic rules, combat state, persistence, diagnostics, natural message intake, and a starter packaged adventure exist as the current baseline — v1.0 Phases 2-5
- ✓ The system can load a formal structured adventure package with reusable schema, state variables, triggers, reveal policy, and branching outcomes — v1.1 Phase 6
- ✓ `疯狂之馆` is the first full-length official module, playable end-to-end with room logic, countdown pressure, hidden information, and multiple endings — v1.1 Phase 7
- ✓ The AI can act as an omniscient DM for packaged modules while reveal-safe state stays gated by current discoveries and canonical module state — v1.1 Phases 6-7
- ✓ Discord play survives restarts through durable campaign bindings, restored natural-message intake, and clearer packaged-adventure status guidance — v1.1 Phase 8
- ✓ Loading a packaged adventure now drives a visible ready-up flow and can auto-open the first scene once the table is ready — v1.2 Phase 9
- ✓ Dice and roll resolution now reuse a mature external engine instead of placeholder values, with command-path support for checks, saves, attacks, damage, and raw expressions — v1.2 Phase 10
- ✓ Discord play now gives clearer pending and blocked feedback through setup guidance, ready gating, and ordinary-message responsiveness improvements — v1.2 Phase 11
- ✓ Narrator output can now stream live into Discord through rate-safe chunked message edits, with fallback to finalized non-streamed replies if streaming fails — v1.2 Phase 12
- ✓ `疯狂之馆` now uses structured runtime judgement to distinguish automatic outcomes, clarification prompts, and explicit roll-needed moments before generic narration takes over — v1.3 Phase 13
- ✓ Light guidance, rescue hints, and stall recovery now come from reusable schema and runtime contracts so players get oriented without being spoon-fed solutions — v1.3 Phase 14
- ✓ Scene entry framing, pressure presentation, and consequence-facing prompts now feel more like a human Keeper while staying grounded in reusable prompt and module structures — v1.3 Phase 15
- ✓ Adventures can now be represented as room graphs with explicit locations, adjacency, and local transition text instead of only sequence-first scene chunks — v1.4 Phase 16
- ✓ The codebase now includes an AI-first, reviewable room-graph extraction draft pipeline for source scripts — v1.4 Phase 17
- ✓ `疯狂之馆` now ships with explicit location graph data and location-driven play behavior such as observing portals without forced entry and natural room returns — v1.4 Phase 18

### Active

- [ ] The next milestone should turn trigger summaries into a reusable, executable trigger tree engine that updates room state, clue state, and downstream options after actions and rolls.
- [ ] Trigger and consequence logic should be reusable across future adventures rather than hardcoded for `疯狂之馆`.
- [ ] The engine should default to declarative configuration, while allowing a small number of code hooks for exceptional mechanics.

### Out of Scope

- Building every D&D subsystem from scratch when stable mature projects or datasets already exist — this is explicitly excluded to reduce debugging cost and delivery time.
- Telegram support in v1 — Discord is the chosen primary runtime environment.
- Full product-grade parity with mature ecosystem bots on day one — v1 should be campaign-usable, not feature-complete against every existing tool.
- Freeform raw-document prompting as the canonical adventure runtime — structured module data is required so the DM does not drift on hidden state and branching rules.
- A full visual adventure authoring tool in this milestone — this round is about one formal module plus reusable schema, not a general editor UI.
- NSFW-specific behavior in this milestone — module and runtime quality take precedence.

## Current State

`v1.4` shifted adventure understanding from sequence-first script chunks toward room graphs, local adjacency, and AI-first extraction. Formal adventures can now carry explicit location data and transition text; runtime state tracks where the table actually is rather than only which scene block is active; and `疯狂之馆` has started migrating into a place-first representation that handles observation, movement, and returns more naturally. The next milestone should build on that by turning trigger summaries into a real execution engine, so room-state changes and roll outcomes propagate through chained consequences rather than stopping at direct prompt text.

## Context

The system will run on Discord and use a dual-model architecture on local inference. The finalized default model split is:

- `qwen3:1.7b` for fast routing, structured intent classification, and tool decision output
- `qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M` for Chinese DM narration, NPC voice, and multi-character roleplay with lower latency on 8GB-class local GPUs

This model split is chosen for local hardware fit and reliability on a machine in the class of `RTX 5060 8GB VRAM + 32GB RAM`. Larger narration models remain possible later, but are not the default because they raise latency and deployment friction on the target setup.

The project should preferentially reuse mature external components instead of inventing custom equivalents. Current candidate references include `DND5E-MCP` as an AI-facing rules/lookup skill, `5e-srd-api` as a stable SRD-backed rules data source, and `Avrae` as a reference implementation for interaction patterns and D&D automation design rather than as the core embedded runtime. For dice resolution, the next milestone should adopt a mature parser and roller such as the Python `d20` ecosystem already used by established Discord D&D tooling instead of expanding the placeholder local roller.

The first release proved the core Discord gameplay loop end-to-end: player input, orchestration, rule/tool invocation, state updates, and narrated DM output. The second milestone turned that into a formal module runtime and then closed the startup, dice, and streaming gaps. `v1.3` shifted from infrastructure quality to live-play craft: judgement about when to call for rolls, deliberate clue timing, bounded light guidance, stronger scene framing, and recovery when players stall or misread the situation. `v1.4` then changed the underlying representation so those behaviors are not tied to sequence-first script chunks: source adventures can now be interpreted as maps of rooms and locations, with interactables, adjacency, reveal-safe movement, and reviewable extraction drafts attached to places. `v1.5` should add the missing trigger execution layer: a general chainable consequence engine that can evaluate declarative conditions, apply effects, and still allow limited code hooks for the edge cases that data alone cannot express cleanly.

## Constraints

- **Platform**: Discord-first — the system must work naturally in Discord channels or threads because that is the chosen runtime surface.
- **Inference**: Local models — narration and control should run through local model infrastructure rather than a hosted LLM dependency.
- **Target Hardware**: Consumer local machine — the default stack should remain practical on `8GB`-class consumer GPUs with `32GB` system RAM.
- **Architecture**: Reuse mature projects first — stable existing tools, APIs, and datasets should be integrated before writing custom subsystems.
- **Rules Scope**: Heavy rules support in v1 — combat, initiative, HP, conditions, spells, and resource tracking are not optional side features.
- **Delivery**: First release should optimize for campaign-usable reliability over maximal scope — reducing integration and debugging cost is a priority.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Discord is the primary platform | It supports the desired multiplayer session format better than Telegram for this project | — Pending |
| The gameplay style is hybrid DM + multi-character performance | The desired experience is DM-led play with scene-based switching into NPC ensemble dialogue | — Pending |
| Multiple real players and bot-played roles are both required | The system must support real group play while also animating the world through NPCs and enemies | — Pending |
| Rules support should be heavy rather than lightweight | The goal is to reduce manual bookkeeping and allow campaign-grade play | — Pending |
| v1 should prioritize end-to-end gameplay over perfect character integration | A playable Discord session loop matters more than building an elaborate character platform first | — Pending |
| Mature external projects and libraries should be the default implementation path | This reduces implementation risk and debugging cost; custom code should be limited to glue and small targeted optimizations | ✓ Good |
| The default narrator should fit 8GB-class local GPUs | Lower deployment friction matters more than marginal prose quality gains from larger local models | `qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4_K_M` selected |
| Router and narrator should remain separate | Roleplay-tuned narration models are not trusted as the sole authority for structured tool routing | `qwen3:1.7b` router retained |
| Formal adventures must be structured data, not raw uploaded prose | Hidden-state modules need deterministic triggers, reveal control, and reusable runtime hooks | ✓ Good |
| `疯狂之馆` is the first official module target | It is rich enough to force a real schema while still being a bounded first module | ✓ Good |
| New runtime subsystems should reuse mature prior art where possible | This reduces debugging cost and keeps the bot aligned with proven Discord D&D workflows | `d20`-style dice integration prioritized for v1.2 |
| Live-play feel now matters more than new runtime primitives | The next milestone should polish judgement, hinting, and scene presentation before expanding breadth | `疯狂之馆` experience polish prioritized for v1.3 |
| Guidance must stay light and bounded | Players should feel oriented, not shepherded through the solution | v1.3 should add tiered hints rather than hard walkthroughs |
| Adventure runtime should be location-first, not script-order-first | Players navigate rooms and places, not paragraphs; the module model should reflect that | v1.4 should introduce room graphs and trigger trees |
| Adventure ingestion should be AI-first with human review | Manual from-scratch authoring will not scale; AI should extract structure under review | v1.4 should add room-graph extraction from source scripts |
| Room-graph migration should remain backward-compatible with the current runtime | Existing narration, persistence, and Discord flow should not be discarded to adopt location-first modeling | v1.4 integrated room graphs into the existing module runtime |
| Trigger logic should be mostly declarative with limited hook escape hatches | Pure data will not cover every module mechanic, but custom code should remain the exception | v1.5 should add a generic trigger engine with minimal hooks |
