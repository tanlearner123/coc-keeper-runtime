## vC.1.3 Phases (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal:** Make campaign/adventure/session state legible in Discord and make message handling reasons explicit to players and operators through logic-first visibility contracts and reusable surfaces.

### Phase 51: Visibility Core Contracts
- Status: Complete
- Plans: 1/1
- Completed: 2026-03-29
- Goal: Define canonical visibility state for campaign, adventure, session, waiting reasons, routing outcomes, and existing player snapshot state.
- Requirements: SURF-01, SURF-02, SURF-03, SURF-04
- Success Criteria:
  1. Discord surfaces read from a shared visibility model instead of ad hoc string assembly
  2. Waiting/blocker reasons are explicit and queryable
  3. Routing outcomes carry a short explanation contract
  4. Existing player snapshot state can be exposed without redefining character semantics

### Phase 52: Player Status Surfaces
- Status: Not Started
- Plans: 0/0
- Completed: -
- Goal: Add player-facing shared status surfaces for current campaign/adventure/session identity and waiting state.
- Requirements: PLAY-01, PLAY-02, CURR-01, CURR-02
- Success Criteria:
  1. Players can see current campaign/adventure/session identity from Discord
  2. Players can see what the table is waiting on and who is pending when relevant
  3. Current-only visibility works without requiring broad browsing UI
  4. Inactive or unloaded states are explained explicitly instead of failing silently

### Phase 53: Handling Reason Surfaces
- Status: Not Started
- Plans: 0/0
- Completed: -
- Goal: Add concise player-facing explanations for why messages were ignored, buffered, deferred, or otherwise routed differently.
- Requirements: PLAY-03, PLAY-04
- Success Criteria:
  1. Players receive short practical handling explanations at the right moments
  2. Explanations are phase-aware and routing-aware
  3. Explanations stay concise enough for ordinary play channels

### Phase 54: KP Ops Surfaces
- Status: Not Started
- Plans: 0/0
- Completed: -
- Goal: Add a separate KP/operator operational surface showing session ops, runtime state, player participation, and routing diagnostics.
- Requirements: OPS-01, OPS-02, OPS-03
- Success Criteria:
  1. KP/operators can see phase, round state, blockers, and current runtime state in one place
  2. KP/operators can inspect per-player ready/submitted/pending style state
  3. KP/operators can inspect routing outcomes without digging through raw logs

### Phase 55: Activity-Ready Boundary Polish
- Status: Not Started
- Plans: 0/0
- Completed: -
- Goal: Consolidate the visibility contracts and surfaces so future Discord Activity UI can reuse the same business logic without rewriting the model.
- Requirements: ACT-01, ACT-02
- Success Criteria:
  1. Visibility contracts are reusable beyond chat-only rendering
  2. Surface implementations clearly separate canonical state from renderer logic
  3. This milestone remains Activity-ready without implementing Activity UI itself

## Future / Deferred

**Post-vC.1.3 ideas:**
- broader campaign/adventure browsing beyond current runtime context
- richer historical operator visibility
- Discord Activity UI implementation
- character semantics redesign outside Track C
