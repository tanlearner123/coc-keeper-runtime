# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Run a real multiplayer D&D session in Discord where a local AI DM can narrate, roleplay multiple characters, and enforce heavy rules flow without constant manual bookkeeping.
**Current focus:** Planning milestone v1.5 for generic chained triggers and consequence execution across reusable modules

## Current Position

Phase: 19 of 21 (Generic Trigger And Consequence Schema)
Plan: 0 of 2
Status: Planning
Last activity: 2026-03-28 - Started milestone v1.5 planning

Progress: [████████░░] 87%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Discord-first runtime remains the primary execution surface for v1.
- Phase 2: One mature low-friction character import path is preferred over a custom sheet platform.
- Phase 2: Deterministic rules authority and 2014 SRD-only scope are fixed v1 guardrails.
- Phase 4: Campaign usability depends on persistence, replayability, and recovery rather than feature breadth.
- Phase 9 target: adventure loading should become a guided ready-up and DM opening flow.
- Phase 10 target: placeholder rolls should be replaced with a mature dice engine, not a custom parser.
- Phase 11 target: Discord should show progress during long DM turns and ordinary message handling should be more transparent.
- Phase 12 target: Ollama narrator output should stream live into Discord through chunked edits with safe fallback.
- Phase 13 delivered structured runtime judgements for direct scene interactions, including automatic outcomes, clarification prompts, and explicit roll-needed prompts.
- Phase 14 delivered reusable light/rescue hint tiers and stall recovery driven by module metadata rather than freeform narrator guesswork.
- Phase 15 delivered stronger scene entry framing, pressure presentation, and return-to-choice pacing for `疯狂之馆`, with reusable hooks for later modules.
- Phase 16 target: adventure runtime should become location-first through room graphs, local interactables, and explicit adjacency.
- Phase 17 target: source scripts should be AI-extracted into room graphs, trigger trees, and reveal-safe runtime drafts.
- Phase 18 target: `疯狂之馆` should migrate into the new room-graph format and improve live navigation and consequence flow.
- Phase 16 delivered location-aware runtime state, adjacency, and room-graph schema support.
- Phase 17 delivered reviewable AI extraction drafts for room graphs and trigger summaries.
- Phase 18 delivered the first location-first migration of `疯狂之馆`, including natural portal observation and room returns.
- Phase 19 target: define a generic chain-capable trigger schema with mostly declarative nodes and limited hook escape hatches.
- Phase 20 target: execute trigger trees at runtime so actions and rolls cause auditable consequence chains.
- Phase 21 target: migrate `疯狂之馆` key progress beats onto the generic trigger engine and verify reuse.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Roadmap now continues with Phases 19-21 for milestone v1.5.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Character import source must stay low-friction and mature; do not expand into a sheet platform.
- Rules and narration boundaries must stay strict so models never become the source of truth for state mutations.
- Dice parsing should be integrated from a mature external library to reduce debugging cost.
- Streaming transport must not become the source of truth for canonical state.
- Discord message edit frequency must stay rate-safe when true streaming is added.
- Presentation polish should stay grounded in structured module logic rather than freeform narrator improvisation as new modules are added.
- AI-first extraction must stay reviewable; the system should not silently turn source scripts into opaque runtime blobs.
- Location graphs should preserve the original script topology and not flatten everything into unordered node soup.
- Trigger execution must stay reusable across future adventures and cannot collapse into `疯狂之馆`-specific imperative code.
