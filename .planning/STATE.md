# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

**Core value:** Run a real multiplayer Call of Cthulhu session in Discord where a local AI Keeper can narrate, roleplay multiple characters, and enforce investigation-heavy rules flow without constant manual bookkeeping.
**Current focus:** v2.1 planning; add a real local delivery smoke check, single-active profile governance, and admin-facing character management

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone planning
Plan: Define and execute Phases 37-39
Status: Active
Last activity: 2026-03-28 - Milestone v2.1 initialized

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- The runtime has already pivoted to COC/Keeper-first semantics and should stay anchored to the local COC rulebooks.
- New complex-module mechanics must be represented either as canonical COC rules or explicit module-specific rules, not hidden prompt invention.
- `覆辙` is the first target complex COC module because it exercises multiple entry tracks, asymmetrical truths, and longer-form scenario state.
- The next milestone should add persistent investigator panels and private knowledge flow before attempting broader complex-module migration.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Roadmap now marks Phases 28-30 complete for milestone v1.8.
- Roadmap now marks Phases 31-33 complete for milestone v1.9, covering adaptive builder interviews, richer identity capture, and archive writeback.
- Phases 34-36 were added for milestone v2.0 to deepen archive schema, archive presentation, and COC-bounded finishing logic.
- Phases 37-39 were added for milestone v2.1 to harden delivery checks and govern long-lived character identity.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Dynamic-form investigator PDFs may still need a non-text-extraction intake path for broader character import.
- Community COC sites remain useful ecosystem references, but canonical runtime truth should stay local and reviewable.
- Future UI work should distinguish what fits native bot interactions from what warrants a Discord Activity.
- Conversational character generation must remain anchored to canonical COC generation rules rather than replacing them.
- Richer panel UX may eventually fit better in a Discord Activity, but the current bot-native archive/builder flow is the supported baseline.
- Richer archive identity now exists, but release confidence is still weak if the bot process is not verified alive after launch.
- Archive ownership and governance rules are still too loose; the next milestone should prevent multiple active identities by default and add admin controls.
