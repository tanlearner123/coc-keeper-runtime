# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Run a real multiplayer D&D session in Discord where a local AI DM can narrate, roleplay multiple characters, and enforce heavy rules flow without constant manual bookkeeping.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: 11 of 11 (Streaming Responses And Message Reliability)
Plan: 2 of 2
Status: Completed
Last activity: 2026-03-27 - Completed milestone v1.2 with onboarding, dice, and response reliability

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Discord-first runtime remains the primary execution surface for v1.
- Phase 2: One mature low-friction character import path is preferred over a custom sheet platform.
- Phase 2: Deterministic rules authority and 2014 SRD-only scope are fixed v1 guardrails.
- Phase 4: Campaign usability depends on persistence, replayability, and recovery rather than feature breadth.
- Phase 9 target: adventure loading should become a guided ready-up and DM opening flow.
- Phase 10 target: placeholder rolls should be replaced with a mature dice engine, not a custom parser.
- Phase 11 target: Discord should show progress during long DM turns and ordinary message handling should be more transparent.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Next roadmap will continue numbering after Phase 11 for the new milestone.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Character import source must stay low-friction and mature; do not expand into a sheet platform.
- Rules and narration boundaries must stay strict so models never become the source of truth for state mutations.
- Dice parsing should be integrated from a mature external library to reduce debugging cost.
- Streaming transport must not become the source of truth for canonical state.
